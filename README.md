# daisyworld_latitudes
Extension of the Daisyworld to handle latitudes
This project was originally made for a presentation for SPS.

## About Daisyworld
Daisyworld is a hypothetical planet introduced by James Lovelock and Andrew Watson to demonstrate the concept of a self-regulating system. In this simulation, daisies are the dominant life form, and their growth and survival are influenced by the planet's temperature.

The daisies on Daisyworld come in two types: black daisies and white daisies. Black daisies have a low albedo, meaning they absorb more sunlight and warm the planet. White daisies, on the other hand, have a high albedo, reflecting more sunlight and cooling the planet.

As the planet's temperature changes, the daisies respond and adapt. This interaction between the daisies and the environment creates a feedback loop that helps maintain the planet's temperature within a certain range. Daisyworld serves as a simple model to explore the principles of planetary ecology and the potential for self-regulation in ecosystems.

The Daisyworld simulation has been widely used as a teaching tool and a thought experiment to study the complex relationships between living organisms and their environment. This extension, Daisyworld_latitudes, expands upon the original simulation by introducing latitude handling, allowing for a more comprehensive exploration of daisy growth and adaptation across different latitudes.\

## Installation
To use the Daisyworld_latitudes widget, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/BharathSShankar/daisyworld_latitudes.git
```
Install the required dependencies:

```ruby
$ pip install numpy matplotlib pandas
```

## Usage
To run the Daisyworld_latitudes widget, open the daisyworld_latitudes.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. Execute the notebook cells to interact with the widget and visualize the Daisyworld simulation with latitude handling.

## Features
The key features of the Daisyworld_latitudes project include:

- Simulation of Daisyworld with latitude handling
- Visualization of daisy growth and coverage at various latitudes
- Analysis of temperature and albedo variations across latitudes

With this extension, users can explore how daisies adapt to different latitudes, providing insights into the effects of solar radiation and temperature changes on their growth.
